## v3.2.2
- Fix ComputeBudget.setLoadedAccountsDataSizeLimit parsing

## v3.2.0
- Export synthetic idls from idl namespace (e.g. `idl.idl.SplTokenIdl`, ixs can be decoded as `ParsedIdlInstruction<idl.SplTokenIdl>`)
- Split decoders into separate files
- Add computeBudget parser

## v3.0.0
- Add support of token22 out of the box
- Rework logs parsing, parse known error types for token & system programs
- ParsedIdlInstruction -> accounts is strictly typed now. Idl accounts are being converted into flat accounts list
- parseTransactionDump supports versioned transactions

### Breaking changes
- Parser requires IDL generated by anchor 0.30.1 (converter from legacy IDLs included)
- parseTransactionDump is async now

## v2.0.0

- Update packages
- Migrate from @project-serum/anchor -> @coral-xyz/anchor

### Breaking changes
- Token instruction `setAuthority`, arg `authorityType` changed from `@solana/spl-token AuthorityType` to IDL enum
- Token instruction `initializeAccount3`, arg `authority` renamed to `owner`
- Token instruction `initializeAccount2`, arg `authority` renamed to `owner`
